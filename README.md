Fun lil game project made with:
- nodejs
- express
- engine.io
- bower
- gulp
- Web kit starter
- materializecss

###Issues:

- The Server is setup to support multiple client on 1 game board, and not multiple boards.
- engine.io is great, but does not have many of the nice 'extra' feature socket.io offers - having to reinvent the wheel with them...


###lesson learned:

- I need to explore more the UI/UX field.
- have a good road map... no have a freaking long yellow brick road if you wanna reach the Wizard!
- setup a good build system and make sure to be able to deploy to production from the start.
- allocate a specific amount of time each day to accomplish a task. This is actually very crutial - too little time and nothing meaningful can be done, while preallocating too much time, give way to procratination ( oddly enough).
